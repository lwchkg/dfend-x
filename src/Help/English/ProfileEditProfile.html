<h1>Profile editor dialog page "Profile"</h1>

<p>
On this page you can configurate the main settings for your profiles.
The content of this pages differs depending of the profile type
(DOSBox profile, ScummVM profile or Windows game profile).
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>Select icon</b><br />
    You can define an icon for each profile. The icon will be shown
    in the games list in most <a href="ViewModes.html">view modes</a>.
    The icons can be managed global via the <a href="ExtrasManageIcons.html">icon manager</a>
    but you can also choose any icon file for use with the profile.
    If you use a custom icon file, you can use relative path names like
    for all other game data.  
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Delete icon</b><br />
    The delete icon button will remove the selected icon from the profile data record.
    The icon file itself will not be deleted when removing the icon from the profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Profile name</b><br />
      The name entered in this field will be shown in the games list. The name will not
      directly be used for the file name (like D-Fend v2 did) so you can enter any
      characters in this field.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Filename</b><br />
    In this field you can edit the filename (without extension) which will be used
    when storing the profile. All non valid characters for filenames will be removed
    automatically. When adding a new profile the filename field will be disabeled
    because the first filename will be generated from the initial profile name.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Program</b> (only availalbe in DOSBox and Windows mode)<br />
    In this box you can define the program file to run and the parameters to use.
    The file name will be stored relatively to the base folder
    (defined on the <a href="FileOptionsDirectories.html">directories</a> page
    of the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog).
    D-Fend Reloaded will translate it to the DOSBox directory structure at
    run time. If the current profile is a DOSBox based profile, you
    can also select <b>File path is relaive to the DOSBox directory structure</b>.
    In this case D-Fend Reloaded will treat the path as a DOSBox pathname
    and will not try to translate it in anyway when running the program file.    
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Setup</b> (only availalbe in DOSBox and Windows mode)<br />
    In this box you can define the setup file to run and the parameters to use.
    The usage of a setup file is optional.
    The file name will be stored relatively to the base folder
    (defined on the <a href="FileOptionsDirectories.html">directories</a> page
    of the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog).
    D-Fend Reloaded will translate it to the DOSBox directory structure at
    run time. If the current profile is a DOSBox based profile, you
    can also select <b>File path is relaive to the DOSBox directory structure</b>.
    In this case D-Fend Reloaded will treat the path as a DOSBox pathname
    and will not try to translate it in anyway when running the setup file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Extra program files</b> (only availalbe in DOSBox and Windows mode)<br />
    Additionally to the program and the setup file you can define more files
    to be associated with the profile via this extra program files button.
    The files defined in this dialog will be offered to run via the
    context menu of the profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>No Windows file warnings for this profile</b> (only availalbe in DOSBox mode)<br />
	D-Fend Reloaded will warn you, if you try to execute a Windows EXE file in DOSBox
	because DOSBox is not able to execute Windows program files. But there are a few games
	containing DOS and Windows code in a single EXE file. When using such an EXE file
	D-Fend Reloaded would warn you because it detects the Windows part of the file. To
	deactivate this (in this case useless) warnings you can activate this option.
	(The checkbox will appear only if a Windows EXE file is selected as game or setup file.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Game</b> (only available in ScummVM mode)<br />
    From this box you can choose the name of the game you want to run.
    (ScummVM needs to know which of the supported games you want to run because
    it applys different settings to the different games.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Game folder</b> (only available in ScummVM mode)<br />
    In this box you can select folder where ScummVM should look for the game
    files and the name of the game to run.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Extract game files from this zip file to the folder</b> (only available in ScummVM mode)<br />
    If this option is checked (and there is a zip file entered in the edit field below) D-Fend Reloaded
    will extract the given zip file to the folder selected in the "Game folder" before running ScummVM.
    ScummVM itself will be executed the normal way with the given game folder. When ScummVM quite
    D-Fend Reloaded will repack the content of the game folder to the archive file and then delete
    the games folder.
  </li>
