There is no special D-Fend Reloaded forum on the D-Fend Reloaded homepage. But
there is a long thread about D-Fend Reloaded on the Vogons ("Very old games on new systems")
forum.
</p>

<p>
On the Vogons forum you will also find answers to many problems about running old games.
Before asking any questions on the forum please note the following things:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
  <b>Legal status of abandonded ware:</b><br />
  Most of the Vogons forum members have a very strict interpretation of copyright laws.
  Also the legal status of abandonded ware is not clear, for most of the Vogons forum members
  any file from an abandonded ware site is illegal. So you will only get answers if you want to
  run old games you really own (by owning the floppy disks). Starting your request with "I have
  downloaded this game and it won't run." will decreate the your probability of getting an answer to zero.</li>
  <li>
  <b>Vogons is not D-Fend Reloaded:</b><br />
  Also I use the Vogons forum for giving support for D-Fend Reloaded the Vogons forum is not related
  to the program in any way. The main subject of the forum is DOSBox. So do not expect all memebers
  to help you with special D-Fend Reloaded questions.</li>
  <li>
  <b>Real type of problem:</b><br />
  If you start your request with "I have a problem with D-Fend Reloaded" you will get the answer:
  "Try running DOSBox without using any Frontend." In most cases you will indeed not having problems
  with D-Fend Reloaded but with running the game inside DOSBox. Because most of the forum members are
  DOSBox experts, it will be much more promising to ask for help running a game inside DOSBox and
  (when requested) posting the DOSBox conf file (which D-Fend Reloaded can create via the context
  menu of a profile or from the profile editor).
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>D-Fend Reloaded is not D-Fend:</b><br />
  Also both program names start with "D-Fend" and both are frontends for DOSBox,
  they are two completely different programs and do not share any source code.
  D-Fend (without "Reloaded") was made for older versions of DOSBox
  and will have some problems working together with newer versions of DOSBox.
  So if you are using D-Fend Reloaded do not post questions like "Game ... won't run with D-Fend."
  because the answer will be "D-Fend is outdated, use D-Fend Reloaded."
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you have read the information above and promise th obey them you can go to the forum now:
