<a onclick="Work('FAQ01')" name="FAQ01" href="#"><h2>&raquo; How does the update checker operate ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ01"><p>
The update checker is reading this file from Sourceforge:
"<a href="http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/UpdateInfo.txt" target="_blank">http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/UpdateInfo.txt</a>".
The file contains two lines; in the first line the version number of the current D-Fend Reloaded
version on the server is given ("<tt>0.6.0</tt>" for example) and in the second line
the download URL of the update installer for this version is given
("<tt>http://downloads.sourceforge.net/dfendreloaded/D-Fend-Reloaded-0.6.0-UpdateSetup.exe</tt>"
for example). If the version number in the <tt>UpdateInfo.txt</tt> is bigger than the
version number of the currently installed D-Fend Reloaded version, the update
checker will ask you, if you want to update to the new version. If you say
"yes", it will download the file from the second line of the <tt>UpdateInfo.txt</tt> to
your temporary directory and will launch it. As the last step it tells Windows
to delete this file as soon as possible. Because the installer is just running,
Windows cannot delete the file and will put it on its "delete on next system
start" list.
</p>

<p>
At the moment the <tt>UpdateInfo.txt</tt> is a static file, but in the future there
could be version depending updates (smaller file to bring you from 0.5.0 to
0.5.1 and a bigger file to bring you from 0.4.1 to 0.5.1). Therefor D-Fend
Reloaded is adding a "<tt>?Version=0.5.0</tt>" (or whatever the current version is) to
the request URL. If you do not want the php script on Sourceforge to know
your current D-Fend Reloaded version, you can change this behavior in the
<a href="FileOptionsSearchForUpdates.html">Search for updates</a>
page of the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog. There is not
privacy risk in sending the current version number because php scripts on
Sourceforge are not allowed to write anything to a file and therefor cannot
log any request.
</p>

<p>
The update checker does nothing else you would do when you look for updates.
The update checker can automatically check for updates when D-Fend Reloaded
is started. But because many people do not like applications "phoning home"
without their permission, this feature is turned off by default. (You can turn
it on in the <a href="FileOptionsSearchForUpdates.html">Search for updates</a>
page of the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog.
And you can manually start the update checker at any time by choosing
<a href="HelpSearchForUpdates.html">Search for updates</a> from the "Help" menu.)
</p>

<p>
The update checker will use the Windows connection settings (which you can edit
in the Internet Explorer). This means: If you have setup a proxy server in the
Internet Explorer, the D-Fend Reloaded update checker will use this proxy, too.
</p>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ02')" name="FAQ02" href="#"><h2>&raquo; I get an "DFend.dat not found" error when running a self made installer package.</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ02"><p>
The self made installer packages do not include D-Fend Reloaded or DOSBox. This
means you have to install D-Fend Reloaded on the computer before you can use
an installer package.
</p>

<p>
If you have installed D-Fend Reloaded in "user directory" mode (the default
installation type), the target directory is still the D-Fend Reloaded program
folder ("<tt>C:\Program Files\D-Fend Reloaded</tt>" for example) and not the data
directory (something like "<tt>C:\Users\you\D-Fend Reloaded</tt>"). The data package
installer will only read from this directory and only copy files to the
data directory, so it can run without admin rights under Vista.
</p>

<p>
If you want to have an all inclusive package, install D-Fend Reloaded in
portable mode to a directory, install or transfer the games to this installation
and then make a zip archive of this directory or simply copy the whole folder
to an USB stick. So you can show your games to others without any installation.
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ03')" name="FAQ03" href="#"><h2>&raquo; I know exactly which setting is on which tab in the D-Fend profile editor dialog. Where is this dialog gone in D-Fend Reloaded ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ03"><p>
D-Fend Reloaded has two profile editor dialogs integrated: The classic D-Fend
style profile editor and the modern profile editor. Both dialogs offer all 
normal settings (settings also available in D-Fend). Which profile editor
should be used can be configured in the 
<a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog in the category
"<a href="FileOptionsProfileEditor.html">profile editor</a>".
This category will only be visible, if you choose "Advanced" as mode in the dialog.
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ04')" name="FAQ04" href="#"><h2>&raquo; I am using a special DOSBox build with some more features. Does D-Fend Reloaded support some of this features ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ04"><p>
Yes, D-Fend Reloaded supports the following CSV build features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple floppy images per drive</li>
  <li>Mounting zip files (PhysFS support)</li>
  <li>28 or 50 lines text mode</li>
  <li>Glide emulation</li>
  <li>VGA chipset and video RAM settings</li>
  <li>Printer emulation</li>
  <li>Some more things (new render types, new graphic cards, new MIDI device) can
  be activated by adding new default values. </li>
</ul>
<p>
To activate the GUI for this settings, open the
<a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog, switch it to
advanced more and activate the settings you want to see in the 
"<a href="FileOptionsDOSBoxCVSFeatures.html">DOSBox CVS features</a>" category.
</p>

<p>
All other special functions of the custom builds are not supported directly at
the moment. But you can tell D-Fend Reloaded to write custom strings in the
DOSBox conf file: All you have to do is writing the lines you want to have
in the conf file in the "Custom settings" edit field in the "DOSBox settings"
category (or in the edit field in the "Custom settings" sheet if you use the
classic profile editor).
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ05')" name="FAQ05" href="#"><h2>&raquo; I have setup "<tt>C:\Users\me\D-Fend Reloaded\VritualHD</tt>" as drive C but DOSBox says it has mounted "<tt>C:\Users\me\D-FEND~1\VIRTUA~1</tt>". What's wrong ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ05"><p>	
"<tt>C:\Users\me\D-FEND~1\VIRTUA~1</tt>" is the short name for "<tt>C:\Users\me\D-Fend
Reloaded\VritualHD</tt>". D-Fend Reloaded translates the long name to the short name
when building the DOSBox configuration file. The Cause is DOSBox can only handle
134 chars per command. So if the path is too long DOSBox perhaps will not mount
it. To avoid this, D-Fend Reloaded changes the path name to the short version.
If you want to turn this off anyway, you can disable the "Use short path
names for mount commands" option in the "<a href="FileOptionsDOSBox.html">DOSBox</a>"
category of the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog.
(The option is only visible in advanced setup mode.)
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ06')" name="FAQ06" href="#"><h2>&raquo; How can I create an other language for D-Fend Reloaded ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ06"><p>	
Just choose the menu item "Translate the program to your language" from the
"Help making D-Fend Reloaded" better sub menu of the "Help" menu. Then choose
"Start new language" and enter the name of the new language.
</p>

<p>
D-Fend Reloaded will then create a new language file and open it in the
build-in language editor. The language editor shows tables for the different
categories (menu, profile editor, setup dialog) with the English texts on
the left side and (editable) your translations on the right side. All you
have to do is make translations of the shown English strings. After closing
the language editor you can activate your language from the setup dialog (its
handled just like the predefined languages).
</p>

<p>
If you want to have your language in the next official D-Fend Reloaded release
just mail the language file to me. (You can find the user defined language
files in the folder "<tt>C:\Users\me\D-Fend Reloaded\Lang</tt>".) And of course you will
get mentioned in the language files section of the program info dialog.
Therefor you should attend one thing: Your name and the name of the language
file are shown in any D-Fend Reloaded installation so make sure this two
strings appear right under any chosen codepage/charset. (This means for
example Cyrillic letters which are not defined in the English charset should
not be used in the language name and in the author name.)
</p>

<p>
If your language file uses a special charset (like cyrillic) and this is the
default charset on your computer, everything will look fine for you (and other
people having the same Windows charset). But on systems with another default
charset your language will look broken. To avoid this, you can tell D-Fend
Reloaded to always use a special charset with your language file by setting
the "Name=" key in the [CharsetSettings] section to one of the following
values: ANSI_CHARSET, DEFAULT_CHARSET, SYMBOL_CHARSET, SHIFTJIS_CHARSET,
HANGEUL_CHARSET, GB2312_CHARSET, CHINESEBIG5_CHARSET, OEM_CHARSET,
JOHAB_CHARSET, HEBREW_CHARSET, ARABIC_CHARSET, GREEK_CHARSET, TURKISH_CHARSET,
VIETNAMESE_CHARSET, THAI_CHARSET, EASTEUROPE_CHARSET, RUSSIAN_CHARSET.
The default value "DEFAULT_CHARSET" tells D-Fend Reloaded to use the Windows
default charset. There is one more thing to mention: The charset setting
applys to all D-Fend Reloaded windows but sadly not to message boxes
which are controled by Windows itself and will always use the Windows
default charset.
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ07')" name="FAQ07" href="#"><h2>&raquo; Is there an easy way of spell checking my new language file ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ07"><p>	
Word processors usualy have quite good spell checkers but if you copy the whole
language file to a word processor you will get a lot of false error messages
because the word processor also trys to correct the "CouldNotDeleteFile=" parts
of the records. To avoid this you can use the following trick: Open the Windows
Notepad, press the tab key, mark the inserted tabulator (8 fields of space)
and copy it to the clipboard. Open the language file, open the replace dialog
in notepad, write in the "search for" field "=" and paste in the tab in the
"replace by" field. (This means replace all "=" by tabs.) Mark the whole file
and copy it in an spread sheet. Mark the second column (only the values
without the "CouldNotDeleteFile=" keys) and copy them to the word processor.
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ08')" name="FAQ08" href="#"><h2>&raquo; Where has the "Edit default profile... (F5)" menu item gone ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ08"><p>	
Because the default template is also a template the option to edit the default
template has moved to the templates editor. The default template will appear in
the templates list of the template editor. To distinguish it from the normal
templates the "Default template" text will appear in blue and you can not
delete it.
</p>

<p>
Also the separate menu item to edit the default template has gone, the hotkey
is still available. You can still reach the template profile editor via the
F5 key.
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ09')" name="FAQ09" href="#"><h2>&raquo; Can I use D-Fend Reloaded in Wine under Linux ?</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ09"><p>	
Running D-Fend Reloaded in Wine is only half-official supported. In the
<a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog in the category
"<a href="FileOptionsWineSupport.html">Wine support</a>" (only visible in advanced setup mode)
you can configurate D-Fend Reloaded to remap the Wine drive letters (<tt>C:</tt>, <tt>D:</tt>
etc.) back to the Linux path names (<tt>/mnt/sta3</tt>, <tt>/mnt/stb1</tt> etc.) when creating
conf files.
</p>

<p>
The way the create link menu command works can also be changed for use on a
Linux system: If you activate "Switch link creation menu item to create Linux
shell scripts", the create link menu command will create shell scripts for
running DOSBox with the selected profile.
</p>

<p>
You can use the same D-Fend Reloaded installation in Windows and Wine (without
changing the setup settings): By calling D-Fend Reloaded with a command line
parameter including "<tt>WineMode</tt>" or "<tt>WineSupportEnabled</tt>" you can override the
setting from the setup dialog and activate the Wine support. By calling D-Fend
Reloaded with a command line parameter including "<tt>WindowsMode</tt>", "<tt>NoWineSupport</tt>"
or "<tt>WineSupportDisabled</tt>" you can override the setting from the setup dialog
and disable the Wine support. The parameters are case insensitive and you can
also write a "-" or a "/" before them if you like to ("<tt>-winemode</tt>" for example
will also be recognized).
</p>
</div>

<a onclick="Work('FAQ10')" name="FAQ10" href="#"><h2>&raquo; I have keyboard problems the DOSBox keymapper cannot fix.</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ10"><p>	
First of all try setting the SDL video driver to "Win DIB" in the DOSBox
section of the D-Fend Reloaded setup dialog. If you still experience keyboard
problems (in particular keys not recogniced by the keymapper, even more in
particular the right shift key) and have pluged a Microsoft eHome receiver (the
official remote control for the Microsoft media centre) to your system, please
follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the "Keyboards" section in the Device Manager.</li>
  <li>Right-click "Microsoft eHome MCIR 109 Keyboard" and choose "Update Driver"
   (called "Update Driver Software" on Vista).</li>
  <li>Choose "Browse my computer for software" (XP users have to tell it not to
   install automatically and say you will specify the location, then when it
   asks you where you would like it to search for drivers choose the option to
   choose from a list) then "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my
   computer".</li>
  <li>Make sure "show compatible hardware" is checked, then select "HID-compliant
   device" and click next. Click any remaining "OK" or "Finish" buttons after
   Windows has installed the driver.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The 109 keys driver is a Japanese keyboard driver. As long as you do not use a
109 keys keyboard doing this will not influence the functionallity of your
keyboard or your remote control. (See also <a href="http://forums.logitech.com/logitech/board/message?board.id=general&amp;message.id=6123" target="_blank">http://forums.logitech.com/logitech/board/message?board.id=general&amp;message.id=6123</a>)

<a onclick="Work('FAQ11')" name="FAQ11" href="#"><h2>&raquo; I get an error message when I try to install the DOSBox movie codec.</h2></a>
<div id="FAQ11"><p>	
To install a video codec you need admin rights on your system. On Windows XP
most user always have admin rights and so can install the codec directly from
the start menu. Under Windows Vista you need to give a program admin rights
manually. Becuase the codec installer is a simple rundll call, it will not
ask for admin rights automatically (like normal installers do). So you need
to click on the start menu item with the right mouse key and have to choose
"Start as admin".
