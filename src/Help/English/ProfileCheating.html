<h1>Change saved game</h1>

<p>
Using this dialog you can change saved games for your advantage (to have more money or your game
character better properties and item etc.). D-Fend Reloaded contains a data base with information
about on which addresses of the saved games of which games which information is stored, so you
can just change the value you want.

<p>
When opening this dialog D-Fend Reloaded will scan the folder of the currently selected game
for files matching to the file masks of the cheat records and will just offer the cheats for
game where there are matching files in the games folder. All you have to do is select one
of the games from the file mask match list, the properties you want to have changed and the
saved game file to change.
</p>

<p>
You can also add cheats to the data base yourself. Either you can add cheats manually via the
<a href="ExtrasEditCheatDB.html">Edit cheats data base</a> dialog or by using the 
öffnen oder über die <a href="ExtrasSearchAddress.html">address search function</a>.
