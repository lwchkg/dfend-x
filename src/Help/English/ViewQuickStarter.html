Menu: &nbsp; <b>View</b> | <b>Show quick starter window</b>
</p>

<h1>Quick starter window</h1>
 
<p>
From the quick starter window you can directly start any DOS program file inside DOSBox.
The quick starter window looks like the Windows Explorer a bit: On the left side there
is a tree structure and on the right side there is a file list.
</p>

<h3>Directory tree</h3>

<p>
In the directory tree on the left side of the quick starter window you can see a list of
directories where your games or game related files can be stored. From the drop down box
at the top of the tree structure you can choose which directories to show. In most cases
it will be easier not to show the complete directory tree of your computer but only the
games directory (defined on the <a href="FileOptionsDirectories.html">directories page</a>
of the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog) with it subdirectories.
</p>

<p>
By clicking on a directory on the left the <b>file list</b> on the right will show the content of
the directory.
</p>

<p>
You can also <b>open any directory inside DOSBox</b> or with the <b>Windows Explorer</b> via the
context menu of the directory tree.
</p>

<h3>File list</h3>

<p>
The file list on the right side of the quick starter window shows the content of the
directory selected in the tree structure on the left.
</p>

<p>
You can <b>open/start</b> any file from the file list just by double clicking it. D-Fend Reloaded
will decide automatically how the file should be started. (Text files will be opened in a
text editor, Windows <tt>exe</tt>E files will just be started, DOS <tt>exe</tt>, <tt>com</tt>
and <tt>bat</tt> files will be started inside DOSBox, images, sounds and videos will be played
by the D-Fend Reloaded previewers.) For some files that can be started but also opened in a
text editor (like <tt>html</tt> files or <tt>bat</tt> files) there is a context menu item to
open the file in a text editor instead of running them the normal way.
</p>

<p>
When starting a file inside DOSBox via the quick starter the <b>template and the settings</b> from
the bottom of the quick starter window will be used.
</p>

<p>
You can also directly <b>make profiles</b> from any DOS program file right via the context menu.
There are two menu items "Make profile from file" and "Make profile from file (wizard)".
The first item will open the <a href="ProfileAdd.html">profile editor</a> with the chosen
program file and the (on the bottom of the quick starter window) chosen template. The
second will open the <a href="ProfileWithWizard.html">profile wizard</a> with the chosen
program file.
</p>

<p>
By <b>dragging and dropping</b> files or folders to the file list on the right of the quick starter window
you can copy files and folders to the selected directory.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="smallH">Hint:</p>
<p class="smallT">
The quick starter window is just a normal window and not a modal dialog. This means you can work on the D-Fend Reloaded main program window
(filtering, changing, starting profiles etc.) while the quick starter window is opened.
