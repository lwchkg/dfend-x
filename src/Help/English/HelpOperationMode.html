<h1>Operation mode</h1>

<p>
This dialog will show you the operation mode D-Fend Reloaded has been installed in.
D-Fend Reloaded can be installed in three different operation modes:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><b>User directory mode</b><br />
  This is the default operation mode. The program files of D-Fend Reloaded and DOSBox will be installed
  to a subdirectory of your program files directory. When runnding D-Fend Reloaded no write access
  to this directory is needed any more. (This means you can run the program without having admin rights.)
  The profiles, settings and games will be stored in the a subdirectory named "D-Fend Reloaded" of your
  user profile directory.
  </li>
  <li><b>Program directroy mode</b><br />
  This mode is only offered for compability with D-Fend (classic). The program files of D-Fend Reloaded
  and DOSBox will be installed to a subdirectory of your program files directory. This directory
  will also be used for profiles, setting and your game files. This means you will need to have
  write access to this directory when running D-Fend Reloaded.
  </li>
  <li><b>Portable mode</b><br />
  This mode mostly behaves like "Program directory mode" but the base directory and the path to DOSBox
  etc. will be stored relatively to the program directory. This means you can copy the program
  directory to any location and everything will be ok. (This is ment for running D-Fend Reloaded and
  DOSBox directly from USB sticks etc.)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The checkboxes and (read-only) edit fields in this dialog will show you the information described above,
too.
