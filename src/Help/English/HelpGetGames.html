<h1>How to get games</h1>

<p>
There are may ways to legally get old DOS games:
</p>

<h2>Old floppy disks</h2>

<p>
If you still own old DOS games on floppy disks and have a computer with a floppy disk drive,
you can directly use this floppy disks:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>You can copy the contents of the floppy disks to hard disk folders and then
  import the games via the menu item "Import from source media" in the "Profile" menu.
  (Choose "Install from folder" in the dialog.)</li>
  <li>If you ware running D-Fend Reloaded on the computer with the floppy disk drive,
  you can directly install the games from the flopy disks. Choose "Import from source media"
  in the "Profile" menu and then select "Install from real floppy disks".</li>
</ul>

<h2>D-Fend Reloaded package manager</h2>

<p>
The menu item "Download packages" from the "Import" submenu of the "File" menu will
open the D-Fend Reloaded package manager. The package manager offers you many freeware
and shareware games for direct download. All you have to do is choose the games you want
to have and click on "Download and install selected games". There is no need to configurate
anything on games installed this way. These games are at once ready to use.
</p>

<h2>Freeware and shareware on the internet</h2>

<p>
On the "Old games" submenu of the "Help" menu you will find a list of many internet pages
offering DOS games and programs (freeware and shareware) for download. In many cases the games
can be dragged and dropped directly to the D-Fend Reloaded program window and being downloaded
and installed by just doing this. (But you can also download the archive files and then drag&amp;drop
the archive files to the program window or use the menu item "Import archive file" from the
"Import" submenu of the "File" menu.) If D-Fend Reloaded already has a matching auto setup template
for the game, the game will be configured automatically and will be ready at once. In the other case
you will be asked for a name for the game and which template to use.
</p>
