<h1>Profile editor dialog page "ScummVM settings"</h1>

<p>
On this page you can configurate some ScummVM specific settings.
Depending on the game chosen on the <a href="ProfileEditProfile.html">profile</a>
page some settings may be disabled.
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>Language</b><br />
    If the game is multilingual you can choose the game language you want to use
    from this dropdown box. If you choose "default" no language information will
	be given to ScummVM. (This option will be visible in the dropdown list if
	there are no language data for the chosen game in the D-Fend Reloaded ScummVM
	games languages list.) By choosing "user defined" you can enter any language
	even so it is not on the list of supported languages. You can also edit the
	list of supported language directly on the <a href="FileOptionsDefaultValues.html">default values</a>
    page of the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Autosave interval</b><br />
    In this box you can select the number of seconds between autosaving.
  </li>    
  <li>
    <b>Text speed</b><br />
    In this box you can change the text speed in the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Enable subtites (in games with voice)</b><br />
    If this option is activated subtitles will be shown in games
    with speech output. (In games without voice support dialogs
    will be shown as text in any case.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Confirm program exit</b><br />
    If this option is activated ScummVM will ask the user if he really wants to
    quit the program if he clicks on the close button of the ScummVM window.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Folder for saved games</b><br />
    From this box you can choose where ScummVM should store the files used for
    saving games. The default setting is using the game directory but you can
    also use any other path for storing the saved games.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Extra path for additional game data files</b><br />
	In this directory you can store additionally game data files.
	(Please see the ScummVM documentation to see for which versions of which
	games this extra directory is supported.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Additional ScummVM command line parameters</b><br />
	The parameters entered here are passed additionally to ScummVM when
	starting the game.
  </li>
   <li>
    <b>Custom settings</b><br />
    The lines entered in this edit field are added to the DOSBox configuration
    file when running DOSBox. You can overwrite all other settings by writing
    something in this box. Also settings perhaps offered by some newer DOSBox
    versions can be used by writing the configuration lines to this field.
  </li>
