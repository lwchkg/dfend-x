<h1>Adding games to D-Fend Reloaded</h1>

<p class="small">
First of all it is recommended to read the main <a href="Introduction.html">introduction</a> to
D-Fend Reloaded. It will explain to you how DOSBox and D-Fend Reloaded work.
</p>

<p>
The text on this page will describe how to add games to D-Fend Reloaded. There are mainly
two ways for adding new games: Completely automatically and wizardbased half manual. <b>To add a new game,
which is stored as a <tt>zip</tt> file, completely automatically,  just drag the game <tt>zip</tt> file to
the D-Fend Reloaded program window.</b> The <tt>zip</tt> file will be extracted to a new created subfolder
of the games directory and the profile will be created automatically (based on an auto setup template if
there is a auto setup template matching to the game). If you want to influence the palce where the game files
are stored and want to influence the profile creation process, you should add the game by the following
two steps:
</p>

<h2>1. Copy the games files to the games folder</h2>

<ul class="big">
  <li> Click on the "Open games folder..." from the "Extras" menu.
  An Explorer window will open and show you the default location for
  storing games. (Of course you can use any location you want, but as
  long as you do not know exactly how D-Fend Reloaded works, you should
  just use this folder.)</li>
  <li>Create a new subfolder for the game in this directory.</li>
  <li>Copy the game files to this new subfolder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Add a profile for the new game</h2>

<ul class="big">
  <li>Click on the "Add with wizard..." menu item from the "Profile" menu.</li>
  <li>The new profile wizard will open and ask you for the type of the new profile.
  If you want to run some old DOS game choose "DOSBox".</li>
  <li>On the next page the wizard will ask you for the game file to start. Just select
  the game program file from the new folder you have created in step 1. (Clicking on the
  "Select file" button on the right side of the game file edit field will bring you
  directly to the default games location.)</li>
  <li>As the last step you will have to choose a template for the new game
  (see also help page for the <a href="ProfileWithWizard.html">new profile wizard</a>).</li>
  <li>On the last two pages of the profile editor normally no changes are needed.</li>
</ul>
