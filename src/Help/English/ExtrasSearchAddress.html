<h1>Search for address in saved game</h1>

<p>
Using this function you can search in saved games for the address of some values
(for example the address for the value of the money in the game). If D-Fend Reloaded finds
an unique address for a value, it can add this address as a new cheat record to the
cheats data base, so you can just use the <a href="ProfileCheating.html">Change saved game</a><br>
function to change saved games of this game from then on.
</p>

<p>
D-Fend Reloaded offers two methods for searching addresses. If you know the exact numerical value
of the property you want to change, you can directly search for this value. If D-Fend Reloaded finds
multiple addresses for this value, it stores the list of addresses and you have to search in a
second file for the value for the same property to reduce the number of possible addresses. Usually
only few steps are needed to find an unique address for some value. This address can be added to the
cheats data base automatically. If you do not know the exact numberical value for the property you want
to change, a more complex method has to be used. As a first step D-Fedn Reloaded is storing a copy of the
saved game file. When you reopen the search dialog you have to tell if the value has increased or decreased
since the last search. D-Fend Reloaded compares the old against the current saved game file to find out
the values at which addresses have been increased or decreased. Doing this multiple times reduces the number
of possible addresses until only one address is left. Using this method usualy takes more steps to find an
unique address for a value than searching for a known value.
