<h1>Search for updates</h1>

<p>
By clicking this option you can manually look for updates for D-Fend Reloaded.
You can also configurate on the <a href="FileOptionsSearchForUpdates.html">Search for updates</a> page
of the <a hre="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog to look for updates automatically
at a chosen interval.
</p>

<p>
The update checker will <b>not</b> transfer any of your private data to the internet.
It will just read the content of a text file offered on the D-Fend Reloaded homepage.
If the version named in this file is bigger than the current version number it will
offer to you to download und run the update installer also named in this text file.
That all.
</p>

<h2>Details on the function of the update checker</h2>

<p>
The update checker is reading this file from Sourceforge:
"<a href="http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/UpdateInfo.txt" target="_blank">http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/UpdateInfo.txt</a>" The file contains two
lines; in the first line the version number of the current D-Fend Reloaded
version on the server is given ("<tt>0.5.0</tt>" for example) and in the second line
the download URL of the update installer for this version is given
("<tt>http://downloads.sourceforge.net/dfendreloaded/D-Fend-Reloaded-0.5.0-UpdateSetup.exe</tt>"
for example). If the version number in the <tt>UpdateInfo.txt</tt> is bigger than the
version number of the currently installed D-Fend Reloaded version, the update
checker will ask you, if you want to update to the new version. If you say
"yes", it will download the file from the second line of the <tt>UpdateInfo.txt</tt> to
your temporary directory and will launch it. As the last step it tells Windows
to delete this file as soon as possible. Because the installer is just running,
Windows cannot delete the file and will put it on its "delete on next system
start" list.
</p>

<p>
At the moment the <tt>UpdateInfo.txt</tt> is a static file, but in the future there
could be version depending updates (smaller file to bring you from 0.5.0 to
0.5.1 and a bigger file to bring you from 0.4.1 to 0.5.1). Therefor D-Fend
Reloaded is adding a "<tt>?Version=0.5.0</tt>" (or whatever the current version is) to
the request URL. There is not
privacy risk in sending the current version number because php scripts on
Sourceforge are not allowed to write anything to a file and therefore cannot
log any request.
</p>

<p>
The update checker does nothing else you would do when you look for updates.
The update checker can automatically check for updates when D-Fend Reloaded
is started. But because many people do not like applications "phoning home"
without their permission, this feature is turned off by default. (You can turn
it on in the category "Search for updates" in the program options dialog.
And you can manually start the update checker at any time by choosing
"Check for updates..." from the "Help" menu.)
</p>

<p>
The update checker will use the windows connection settings (which you can edit
in the Internet Explorer). This means: If you have setup a proxy server in the
Internet Explorer, the D-Fend Reloaded update checker will use this proxy, too.
