<h1>Profile editor dialog page "Memory"</h1>

<p>
On this page you can setup how much memory and what kind of
memory DOSBox should give to the game.
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>Memory (in MB)</b><br />
    In the box you can enter the total number of MB DOSBox should give to the game
    you want to run.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use XMS memory</b><br />
    By activating this checkbox you activate the XMS support inside DOSBox.
    If the game you want to run wants to use XMS memory, all you have to do
    is activating this checkbox. (There is no need to install a separate memory manager
    like EMM386 etc.) You should always keep this option activated unless
    the game you want to run has problems when XMS memory is activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use EMS memory</b><br />
    By activating this checkbox you activate the EMS support inside DOSBox.
    If the game you want to run wants to use EMS memory, all you have to do
    is activating this checkbox. (There is no need to install a separate memory manager
    like EMM386 etc.) You should always keep this option activated unless
    the game you want to run has problems when EMS memory is activated.
  </li>  
  <li>
    <b>Use UMB memory</b><br />
    By activating this checkbox you activate the UMB support inside DOSBox.
    If the game you want to run wants to use UMB memory, all you have to do
    is activating this checkbox. (There is no need to install a separate memory manager
    like EMM386 etc.) You should always keep this option activated unless
    the game you want to run has problems when UMB memory is activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use Loadfix</b><br />
    If you have problems running some game you can try to activate this
    option. It will reduce the amount of memory available to programs running in DOSBox
    because some games have problems if there is too much available memory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use DOS32A extender</b> <font color="red">(*)</font><br />
    If the game you want to run uses some DOS extender like DOS4/GW you can replace
    the DOS extender by DOS32A which is faster than most of the other extenders.
    D-Fend Reloaded will show you via an icon right to the checkbox if the game you
    want to run uses a DOS extender or not. You should only activate this option
    if the game you want to uses a DOS extender.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The option marked with <font color="red">(*)</font> is implemented by using the FreeDOS
DOS32A extender. This means FreeDOS must be available to use this options. You can configurate the
path to FreeDOS on the <a href="FileOptionsFreeDOS.html">FreeDOS</a> page of the
<a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog. If the information text below the option
is displayed in gray, FreeDOS is available. Otherwise the text will be displayed in red.
