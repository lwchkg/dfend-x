On this page you can setup the virtual graphic card DOSBox or ScummVM should emulate.
</p>

<h2>For DOSBox profiles</h2>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>Window resolution</b><br />
    In this dropdown box you can select the resolution you want to use if
    DOSBox is running in window mode. "Original" means using the resolution
    the game uses without scaling. In all other cases DOSBox is upscaling
    the game resolution to the chosen resolution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Fullscreen resolution</b><br />
    In this dropdown box you can select the resolution you want to use if
    DOSBox is running in fullscreen mode. "Original" means using the resolution
    the game uses without scaling. In all other cases DOSBox is upscaling
    the game resolution to the chosen resolution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Start in fullscreen mode</b><br />
    If this option is activated, DOSBox will start in fullscreen mode.
    Otherwise it will start in window mode.
  </li>  
  <li>
    <b>Use double buffering</b><br />
    If this option is activated double buffering will be activated in fullscreen mode.
    Activation this option can cause or solve some graphic problems depending on your
    video driver, your operation system and the game you want to run.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Keep correct aspect</b><br />
    Aspect correction is useful for games that uses the 320x200 mode with non-square pixel.
    If a game using this mode is displayed on a modern screen using a mode with regular square pixel
    it looks stretched. Aspect correction stretches the image vertically so the 320x200 will become
    320x240 and it looks better depending on the interpolation algorithm.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Glide emulation <font color="red">(*)</font></b><br />
    If this option is activated DOSBox will offer glide emulation to the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Render</b><br />
    From this dropdown box you can choose the output method DOSBox should use
    to display the content of its window (this means the way DOSBox will
    communicate with the Windows device driver). The default value is "surface".
    The best render method depends on your video driver and operating system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Video card</b><br />
    From this dropdown box you can select the graphic card type you want DOSBox to emulate.
    For most games "vga" should work fine. Only if the game requieres some special graphic card
    you should select some other video card type. Note that "vga" fully supports most cga modes,
    so you should be able to leave DOSBox in vga mode for playing most cga games.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pixel shader <font color="red">(*)</font><b><br />
	From this dropdown box you can select the pixel shader program to use.
	The pixel shader programs offered in this box are <tt>fx</tt> files in the
	<tt>Shaders</tt> subdirectory of the directory of the chosen DOSBox installation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Settings for video card type "vga" <font color="red">(*)</font></b><br />
    In this box you can select the exact type of vga card to emulate in video card mode "vga".
    This can be helpful when running some newer DOS games expecting some special vga chipset.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Scale</b><br />
    From this dropdown box you can select the scale algorithm to use when displaying a
    game in a higher resolution than the game uses. The best scaling mode depends on the
    game you want to use. In general modes at the top of the list tend to be faster
    and modes at the bottom tend to produce smoother images.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Frameskip</b><br />
    In this box you can select how many frames DOSBox should skip when showing the game frames.
    Skipping frames makes the running a game faster. The frameskip is not based on the games
    frames per second (fps), but on the screen refresh rate, which is 70 fps for most modes and 60 fps
    for 640*480 VGA modes. A frameskip of one means 35 / 30 fps, a frameskip of two means 23.3 / 20 fps
    and three means 17.5 / 15 fps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Text mode lines <font color="red">(*)</font></b><br />
    In this box you can select how many text lines DOSBox should use in
    text mode (on the command line for example). The default value is 25.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The settings marked with <font color="red">(*)</font> are only visible if the corresponding
DOSBox CVS features are enabled on the <a href="FileOptionsDOSBoxCVSFeatures.html">DOSBox CVS features</a>
page of the <a href="FileOptionsDOSBox.html">program options</a> dialog. The official DOSBox 0.72 build
delivered with D-Fend Reloaded does not support these special settings.
</p>

<h2>For ScummVM profiles</h2>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>Filter</b><br />
	From this box you can select the method ScummVM should use for up scaling the game graphics
	to your physical resolution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Render mode</b><br />
	In the box you can setup the graphical card ScummVM should emulation. In most cases the
	default value "default" will lead to good results.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Start in fullscreen mode</b><br />
    If this option is activated, ScummVM will start in fullscreen mode.
    Otherwise it will start in window mode.
  </li>  
  <li>
    <b>Keep correct aspect</b><br />
    Aspect correction is useful for games that uses the 320x200 mode with non-square pixel.
    If a game using this mode is displayed on a modern screen using a mode with regular square pixel
    it looks stretched. Aspect correction stretches the image vertically so the 320x200 will become
    320x240 and it looks better depending on the interpolation algorithm.
