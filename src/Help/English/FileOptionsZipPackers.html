<h1>Program options dialog page "Archiving programs"</h1>

<p>
On this page you can configurate external archiving programs. With the help of this programs
D-Fend Reloaded will be able to handle some other archive formats. (Support for the zip and 7z
archiv files is already buildin.)
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><b>Name of archiving program</b><br />
  From this dropdown box you can select the program you want to configurate. Via the four
  buttons on the right of this box you can add, delete and sort the entries of this box.</li>
  <li><b>Programm filename</b><br />
  In this input line you can enter the path and the filename of the external archiving program
  you want to use.</li>
  <li><b>File extensions to handle</b><br />
  In this input line you can define which file type you want to be handled by the
  external archiving program. The filename extension in the line must be divided by
  ";" and must be entered without leading "*.". If you enter "ZIP" or "7Z" as supported
  formats for some external programs, D-Fend Reloaded will use this external program
  to extract and pack this archive formats instead of the internal functions.</li>
  <li><b>Commandline for extracting an archive file</b><br />
  In this inputline you can define the commandline parameters to be used when calling
  the archiving program to extract an existing archive file. The placeholder
  "<tt>%1</tt>" will be replaced by the path and filename of the existing archive file and
  the placeholder "<tt>%2</tt>" will be replaced by the path name of the folder where the
  archive file should be extracted to.</li>
  <li><b>Commandline for creating an archive file</b><br />
  In this inputline you can define the commandline parameters to be used when calling
  the archiving program to create a new archive file. The placeholder
  "<tt>%1</tt>" will be replaced by the path and filename of the new archive file and
  the placeholder "<tt>%2</tt>" will be replaced by the path name of the folder which
  should be packed into the archive file.</li>
  <li><b>Commandline for adding files / updating an archive file</b><br />
  In this inputline you can define the commandline parameters to be used when calling
  the archiving program to update an existing archive file. The placeholder
  "<tt>%1</tt>" will be replaced by the path and filename of the archive file and
  the placeholder "<tt>%2</tt>" will be replaced by the path name of the folder which
  should be added to the archive file.</li>
  <li><b>Add trailing "\" to path names.</b><br />
  Defines whether the path names where the files to pack are located or where the archive
  file should be extracted to should include a trailing "\" or not. (Some external packers
  like uha do not work correctly if the path name has a trailing "\".)
  </li>
  <li><b>Set default values for ...</b><br />
  D-Fend Reloaded already knows the right parameters for packing and extracting archive file
  for some archiving programs. The the currently chosen archiving program is already known,
  you can set the default parameters in the three input lines above by clicking this button.</li>
