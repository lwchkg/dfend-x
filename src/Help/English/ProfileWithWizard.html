</p>

<h1>Add with wizard</h1>

<p>
The profile wizard offers you a very easy way of adding new profiles to
D-Fend Reloaded. The profile wizard consists of five pages. D-Fend Reloaded
will show two to all five pages depending on the already known and still needed
information on the game.
</p>

<h2>Page 1: Type of the profile</h2>

<p>
One the first page all you have to choose is the profile type:
You can add <b>a DOSBox based profile, a ScummVM profile or a profile for a Windows game</b>.
(The option "Scumm-based adventure" will only be offered if you have defined the path to
ScummVM in the <a href="FileOptionsScummVM.html">program options dialog</a>.)
You can run nearly all DOS games by using DOSBox. ScummVM is only used
for the old Scumm adventures.
</p>

<p>
Additionally you can setup how many things the wizard should ask you. If you keep
the default setting "Only setup game automatically if matching auto setup template exists",
the wizard will already close after the first two pages if the new game has beend indentified
via an auto setup template, because in this case the new profile can be created completely
automatically with no need of any user interaction. Alternatively you can setup that the
wizard should always show all pages or that the wizard should always close after the
first two pages. (If there is no matching auto setup template and if the wizard should
always close after the first two pages, D-Fend Reloaded will try to configurate the game
via the default template.)
</p>

<h2>Page 2: Program files (for a new DOSBox profile)</h2>

<p>
One this page you can select the <b>program file</b> and optionally
a <b>setup file</b> for the profile. The program file defined on
this page will be started inside DOSBox if you double click on the
profile in the games list later.
</p>

<p>
To allow D-Fend Reloaded to use realtive path names, the game files
should be located in the folder shown as "<b>Recommend parant directory</b>"
(see also the <a href="Introduction.html">introduction to D-Fend Reloaded</a>
for a description of the recommended directory structure). You can also
setup the default games folder offerend on this page on the
<a href="FileOptionsDirectories.html">directories page</a> of then
<a href="FileOptions.html">program options dialog</a>.
</p>

<p>
By pressing the <b>Setup additonal files manually</b> you can extended the dialog
to show you an input line for defining an additional folder for manuals etc.
The content of this folder will be shown on the bottom of the main window
when single clicking on the profile in the games list later.
Alternatively you can check <b>Setup additional files directory automatically</b>
option to let D-Fend Reloaded automatically create an data folder based on the name
of the new profile.
</p>

<h2>Page 2: Program files (for a new ScummVM profile)</h2>

<h2>Page 3: Settings (for a new DOSBox profile)</h2>

<p>
On this page you can define the main game settings. Setting up games via
the profile wizard mainly means choosing a template to use. There are 5
different template usage modes:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>Use compatible auto setup template</b><br />
    The templates listed in this dropdown box are found to be compatible
    with the selected game. (They match to the program file via a checksum.)
    If there is a auto setup template listed in this drowdown box it
    is recommended to choose it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use auto setup template which only matchs by filename</b><br />
    The templates listed in this dropdown box  match to the given program file
    by the filename but not by the checksum. May be your game version just differs
    from the game version the auto setup template was made from. If this list
    of compatible auto setup templates but there are templated listed in this
    dropdown box, you should select one from this list.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use user-defined auto setup template</b><br />
    In this dropdown box you will find all available auto setup templates.
    If there are no entries in the two lists above and if you are sure your
    new game is one from this list, you can choose the corresponding auto setup template.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use user-defined template</b><br />
    In this dropdown box you will find all user-defined templates.
    You can use any of this templates for new profiles at any time.
    But this templates do not contain any settings specific for a the selected game.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use default wizard template</b><br />
    Choosing this radio button will result in using a built-in wizard template
    for the new profile. Via the dropdown box and the checkboxes below you can
    select some settings for the new profile.
  </li>
</ul>

 
<h2>Page 3: Settings (for a new ScummVM profile)</h2>

<p>
On this page you can configurate some additional settings for the 
seleced game. The settings offered on this page depend on the game
you have selected on the last page.
</p>

<h2>Page 4: Game information</h2>

<p>
On this page you can define many additional game information like name, genre, developer etc.
The information entered on this page are shown in the games list (in view mode
<a href="ViewModes.html">report</a>) and the profiles can be filtered by them.
</p>

<p>
Via the "<b>Look up game at ...</b>" you can search for the profile name on different 
classic game related search engines.
</p>

<p>
If you are just adding a DOSBox based profile via a auto setup template, the game information
page will not be shown because all additional game information are already included in the template.
</p>

<h2>Page 5: Virtual drives (for a new DOSBox profile)</h2>

<p>
On this page you can select the virtual drives DOSBox should use. The game files must be reachable
inside DOSBox to be able to start the game. D-Fend Reloaded will try to detect which drives are
needed automatically and will create drive records on this page. If the settings made on this page
are not sufficient, you can change the drive settings via the
<a href="ProfileEdit.html">profile editor</a> at any time.
