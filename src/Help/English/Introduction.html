<h1>Introduction to D-Fend Reloaded</h1>

<p>
The information on this page will give you an overview about what D-Fend Reloaded is and how to handle it.
</p>

<a onclick="Work('DOSBox')" name="DOSBox" href="#"><h2>&raquo; What is DOSBox ?</h2></a>

<div id="DOSBox"><p>
DOSBox emulates an x86 PC including all hardware needed to run DOS programs. With this you can run
nearly all of your old DOS games and programs on modern operating systems like Windows or Linux.
</p>
<p>
Unlike most other emulators (like Bochs or QEmu) DOSBox not only emulates the hardware of an x86 PC but
also an MS-DOS compatible operation system. This means you can start directly running your old games
without needing to install some operation system first. (But anyway you can install a custom operation
system inside DOSBox if you want to.) Additonally DOSBox is much easier to handle than any of the other
emulators and virtualizers: There is no need to install any system driver etc. to use it. It is even
possible to run DOSBox directly from a USB stick. You can just mount any real folder as a drive inside
DOSBox (this means there is no need to use harddisk image files, but of couse DOSBox can also handle harddisk images). 
</p></div>

<a onclick="Work('D-Fend-Reloaded')" name="D-Fend-Reloaded" href="#"><h2>&raquo; What is D-Fend Reloaded ?</h2></a>

<div id="D-Fend-Reloaded"><p>
Even so DOSBox is easy to handle compared to most of the other emulators, there is no graphical environment to
setup the hardware used by the games and if you want to run different games needing different hardware setups
you need to keep different versions of the DOSBox configuration file and always need to start DOSBox using the
right configuration file.
</p>

<p>
To make things easier for the user there a several frontends for DOSBox. They offer dialogs for setting up
DOSBox for different games. Also some of them can handle additional data for the games (manual files and
captured screenshots).
</p>

<p>
D-Fend Reloaded is a DOSBox frontend for the Windows plattform. Inside D-Fend Reloaded you can manage your games just like
links in the start menu. Inside the <a href="ProfilesEdit.html">profile editor</a> you can setup every option
DOSBox is offering. To make things even easier there is a <a href="ProfilesWizard.html">profile adding wizard</a>
which will only ask you very few question and try to automatically setup all nessessary things for you. Addtionally
D-Fend Reloaded can store additionally files (like manuals) together with each game and can manage and view/play captured
screenshots, sound and videos. You can even use your captured screenshots in the games list instead of plain
text links.
</p>

<p>
Long time ago there has been a freeware frontend called "D-Fend". But some day the development of this program has been
stopped and it has been removed from the internet. D-Fend Reloaded is a complete rewrite of D-Fend. It is nearly 100%
compatible with D-Fend (you can upate from D-Fend to D-Fend Reloaded by just replacing the program file if you want to).
But by now D-Fend Reloaded has many new features D-Fend never had.
</p></div>

<a onclick="Work('DirectoryStructure')" name="DirectoryStructure" href="#"><h2>&raquo; Directory structure</h2></a>

<div id="D-Fend-Reloaded"><p>
You can place the games, you want to manage inside D-Fend Reloaded, in any directory you want to, but there will be some
advantages (easier moving games from one installation to an other) if you keep some rules when storing games.
</p>

<p>
The normal installation ("User mode") has two main directories for storing data: The program directory  and the
data directory
</p>

<h3>The program directory (usually <tt>C:\Program files\D-Fend Reloaded</tt>)</h3>

<p>
In the program directory all program files needed to run D-Fend Reloaded and DOSBox will be stored. D-Fend Reloaded
will not write to this directory after installation any more. (This means D-Fend Reloaded is compatible to the Vista way
of dividing program files and data files.)
</p>

<h3>The data directory (usually <tt>C:\Users\<i>YourName</i>\D-Fend Reloaded</tt>)</h3>

<p>
All user files (programm configuration, game program files, manuals, captured files, etc.) should be stored in this
directory and its subdirectores. The games files are stored in the subdirectories of the data directory:
</p></div>

<ul class="big">
  <li><b>Settings:</b> This folder is used by D-Fend Reloaded to store its configuration files.</li>
  <li><b>VirtualHD:</b> This folder will be mounted as drive "<tt>C:</tt>" inside DOSBox (as long as you do not change
  this behavior for a profile). If you place your games in subdirectories of this folder you will be able to access them
  inside DOSBox without having to setup anything special in D-Fend Reloaded. Additionally you cannot damage your Windows
  installation if you accidentally delete your whole virtual harddisk inside DOSBox as long as you have only mounted this
  folder as drive "<tt>C:</tt>" inside DOSBox and not your whole real harddisk.</tt></li>
  <li><b>Capture:</b> D-Fend Reloaded will create a subfolder in this folder for each profile you create. (Of course
  you can also define some other capture folder.) The profile capture folder will be used by DOSBox to store captured
  images, sounds and videos. D-Fend Reloaded will show the captured files for each profile just below the profiles
  list. All you have to do is select a profile and you will see the corresponding screenshots etc.</li>
  <li><b>GameData:</b> D-Fend Reloaded can create a subfolder of this folder for each profile you have (optionally and
  even of course also in any other folder). You can store addtional game files (like manuals etc.) here. You can access
  the content of this folder also via the information area below the profiles list or via the profile context menu.</li>
  <li><b>Confs:</b> This folder is used to store the <tt>prof</tt> files for the games. Each <tt>prof</tt> file contains
  one profile. You can add your old D-Fend profiles just by copying the D-Fend <tt>prof</tt> files to this folder.
  (Attention: D-Fend stores each profile in a DOSBox <tt>conf</tt> and a <tt>prof</tt> file. If you import the whole
  content of the D-Fend <tt>Confs</tt> folder (via the import function from the file menu) you will have each profile
  twice. It is recommended to only import the <tt>prof</tt> files (because they contain more information than the
  corresponding <tt>conf</tt> files).</li>
  <li><b>AutoSetup, Lang, Templates:</b> This folders are used internally by D-Fend Reloaded to store the auto setup
  templates, the language files and the normal profile templates. Of couse you can manually add templates by copying
  them to this folders but are is also the much more easily operated <a href="ExtrasTemplates.html">template editor</a>
  inside D-Fend Reloaded.</li>
</ul>

<a onclick="Work('AddingProfiles')" name="AddingProfiles" href="#"><h2>&raquo; Adding new profiles</h2></a>

<div id="AddingProfiles"><p>
The absolute easiest way of adding games to the list (if the game is stored as a <tt>zip</tt> file) is draging the
<tt>zip</tt> file to the D-Fend Reloaded program window. D-Fend Reloaded will copy the game files to a new created
subdirectory of the games folder and will try to automatically setup the new game via an auto setup template. If
there is no auto setup template matching to the new game, D-Fend Reloaded will aplly the default template to the
new profile. In most cases this will result in a correctly working new profile. But this way of adding new games
does not allow the user to influence the process of profile creation. (Of couse you can edit the new profile later
like any profile via the profile editor.)</p>
<p>

<p>
The easiest way of adding profiles while letting user influence the process 
is via the <a href="ProfilesWizard.html">profile adding wizard</a> ("Add with wizard..."
in the "Profile" menu or <span class="key">F3</span>-key). The profile wizard will only ask you the really nessessary
things: The name for the new profile, the <tt>exe</tt> file to execute inside DOSBox and some game settings.
D-Fend Reloaded already knows over 350 games (the auto setup templates). If you add a known game it will offer you
to completely automatically setup the game for you. If you want to add a game D-Fend Reloaded does not know, it
will offer you to choose a template (of the type "low CPU power", "normal", "3D graphics"). Additionally you can
add some information like author, publisher, language, year etc. to the profile and that's it, your new profile
is ready.
</p></div>

<a onclick="Work('RunningGames')" name="RunningGames" href="#"><h2>&raquo; Running Games</h2></a>

<div id="RunningGames"><p>
If you have defined a profile for your game, starting the game is very easy: Double click the profile name in the
profile list on the right side of the program window. (Or select the profile and press <span class="key">Enter</span>
or select the profile and click on the "Run" toolbar button.) D-Fend Reloaded will run the game inside DOSBox. If you
capture any images inside DOSBox (by pressing <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">F5</span>) or any sounds
(by pressing <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">F6</span> to start/stop) or any videos (by pressing
<span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">Alt</span>+<span class="key">F5</span>) D-Fend Reloaded will show you
this files in the bottom area of the program window. If you click on a screenshot, you will get a bigger preview and
if you click on a captured sound or video file, D-Fend Reloaded will play the file.
