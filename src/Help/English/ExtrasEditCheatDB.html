<h1>Edit cheats data base</h1>

<p>
From this dialog you can edit the D-Fend Reloaded cheats data base.
You can edit or delete existing cheats or add new records.
</p>

<p>
In the upper part of the dialog you can select which game and which action belonging to
the game you want to change. Action can be "More money" or "Improve game characters".
Each action itself can consist of multiple steps. Every change of an address is one
step of an action.
</p>

<p>
In the lower part of the dialog you can edit the data for the selected step of the selected
action of the selected game. Mainly D-Fend Reloaded knows two kinds of cheating steps.
It can change the value on an address of a saved game to a new, fixed value or it can
ask the user which value to write to the address. You can enter decimal or hexadecimal numbers
into all value and address fields. If you want you number to be interpreted as a hexadecimal
number you need to write a "$" before the number.
</p>

<p>
The cheats configurated in this dialog can be applied to games via the
<a href="ProfileCheating.html">Change saved game</a> function. If you do not know exactly the
address of the value you want to change in the saved game file, you can use the
<a href="ExtrasSearchAddress.html">Search for address in saved game</a> function.
