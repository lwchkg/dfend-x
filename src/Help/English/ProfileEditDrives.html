<h1>Profile editor dialog page "Drives"</h1>

<p>
On this page you can setup the virtual drives DOSBox should emulate for
the games running inside it. DOSBox can use physical drives, folders,
image files or (if you are using a special CVS build) zip files as drives.
Additionally D-Fend Reloaded allows to use zip files as drives even with
the default DOSBox build (by extracting them before running DOSBox and
automatically repacking them when DOSBox quits.)
</p>

<p>
You can add, edit and delete drives by clicking the buttons at the
bottom of the page. Additionally you can also add drives by pressing
<span class="key">Ins</span>, edit the selected drive by pressing
<span class="key">Return</span> and delete drives by pressing
<span class="key">Del</span>.
</p>

<p>
You can also let D-Fend Reloaded try to create the needed connections
from physical folders to DOSBox drives automatically by clicking the
"<b>Auto create</b>" button. This should work fine for games only needing
their game directories to run. For games needing drive images or
CD drive connections D-Fend Reloaded will not be able to setup all needed
drive records automatically.
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><b>Additional automatically mount all available CDs</b><br />
    If this option is activated, D-Fend Reloaded will also mount all not explicitely mounted CD drives
	when starting DOSBox.
  </li>
  <li><b>Disable mounting of drives after DOSBox start</b><br />
    If this secure mode is activated, you (or any program inside DOSBox) will not be able to
	mount any further drives as soon as DOSBox is started. Whis this option activated you can be
	sure even a virus will not be able to damage any data you have not explicitely mounted
	in this dialog.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The "Edit drive" dialog</h2>

<p>
From this dialog you can choose the type of drive DOSBox should emulate and
configurate it. From the "<b>Type</b>" dropdown box you can select on of the
following drive types:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><b>Folder as hard disk</b><br />
  This option allows you to mount any folder as a hard disk in DOSBox.
  (Advice: You should <b>not</b> mount the root folder of a drive as
  a DOSBox drive. Mounting a complete drive as a DOSBox drive will
  allow applications running inside DOSBox to change or delete any file
  on the real hard disk.) 
  </li>
  <li><b>Folder as floppy</b><br />
  This option allows you to mount a folder as a virtual floppy disk.
  </li>
  <li><b>CD-drive</b><br />
  This options allows you to mount a real CD drive a a virtual CD drive
  inside DOSBox. You can select the CD drive via a fixed path (which should
  be the root folder of a real CD drive) or let D-Fend Reloaded automatically
  select the CD drive on DOSBox start via a file or a folder on the CD or
  via the name of the CD.
  </li>
  <li><b>Floppy image</b><br />
  This options allows you to mount an image file as a virtual floppy drive.
  Via the "Create image file" on the right you can
  <a href="ExtrasImagesCreateImageFromFloppy.html">create a new floppy image from a real floppy disk</a>
  or <a href="ExtrasImagesCreateImage.html">create a new, empty floppy disk image</a>.
  </li>
  <li><b>ISO image</b><br />
  This options allows you to mount an image file as a virtual CD drive.
  Via the "<a href="ExtrasImagesCreateImageFromCD.html">Create image file</a>" on the right you can create a new ISO image
  from a real CD drive.
  </li>
  <li><b>Hard disk image</b><br />
  This options allows you to mount an image file as a virtual hard disk.
  Via the "<a href="ExtrasImagesCreateImage.html">Create image file</a>" on the right you can create new, empty hard disk images.
  </li>
  <li><b>DOSBox PhysFS</b> <font color="red">(*)</font><br />
  By selecting this option you can mount a zip file as a drive in DOSBox.
  DOSBox will make a drive from a zip file and a folder. It will read from the
  zip file and perform all write operations to the given folder (the zip file is read only).
  Wehn DOSBox terminates the content of the folder can optionally be added to the
  zip file.
  </li>
  <li><b>Zip file</b><br />
  By selecting this option you can mount a zip file as a drive in DOSBox
  without using the DOSBox PhysFS support (which is not available in all DOSBox versions).
  D-Fend Reloaded will extract the content of the zip file to the given folder,
  mount this folder as a drive in DOSBox, run DOSBox, waits for DOSBox to terminate
  and then optionally repack to folder content to the zip file.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The option marked with <font color="red">(*)</font> is only available if the corresponding
DOSBox CVS feature is enabled on the <a href="FileOptionsDOSBoxCVSFeatures.html">DOSBox CVS features</a>
page of the <a href="FileOptionsDOSBox.html">program options</a> dialog. The official DOSBox 0.73 build
delivered with D-Fend Reloaded does not support this mount type and does not support the secure mode.
</p>

<p>
Via the "<b>Drive letter</b>" dropdown box you can choose which drive letter DOSBox should use
for the mounted folder or image. When mounting a floppy or hard disk image you can also choose
a number from 0 to 3 instead of a drive letter. Choosing one of this numbers will connect to image
to the internal floppy / hard disk controller instead of connecting it to a drive letter. By doing this
the drive will also stay available when booting a custom operation system inside DOSBox.
