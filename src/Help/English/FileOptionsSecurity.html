<h1>Program options dialog page "Security"</h1>

<p class="small">
This page will only be visible if the advanced setup mode is selected at the bottom of the program options dialog.
</p>

<p>
On this page you can setup the functions that will protect you agains deleting wrong files:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>Ask before deleting game records</b><br>
    If this option is activated, D-Fend Reloaded will ask you if you really want to delete the selected profile if you press
    <span class="Key">Del</span> in the games list. If this option is turned off, the profile will be deleted with out any
    warning.<br />(Default value for this option: on)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Never delete files outside the base folder when uninstalling games</b><br>
    As long as this option is activated, D-Fend Reloaded will not delete any file outside the
    <a href="FileOptionsDirectories.html">base folder</a> when uninstalling a game.
    With this option activated uninstalling misconfigurated games can not damage your regular
    software installation. If this option is turned off and in the profile you want to
    uninstall <tt>C:\Windows\</tt> is defined as the game folder to delete, your operation
    system can get damaged.
    <br />(Default value for this option: on)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Monitor changes of the DOS program files by using checksums</b><br>
    D-Fend Reloaded can store checksums in each profile for the game and the setup file.
    It will compare the stored checksum with the one calculated from the program file
    when you try to start a DOS program. If the checksums does not match, D-Fend Reloaded
    will warn you. This function can detect changes made by a virus to the exe file or
    if you try to use a profile file on a game for which the profile was not made.
    <br />(Default value for this option: on)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Move files to recycle bin when deleting</b><br>
	  In this box you can select which files should be moved to the recycle bin when
  	deleting them and which files should be deleted irrevocable.
	  <br />(Default value for this option: Move all non temprary files to recycle bin)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Offer to run DOSBox etc. as admin in profile editor</b><br>
	If this option is activated some additional checkboxes will appear in the
	profile editor allowing to run DOSBox, ScummVM or the selected Windows
	program with admin rights. Usually there is no need to run normal applications
	with admin rights. Running a program with admin rights just increases the risk
	to damage your software installation. If the option here is deactivated, not
	only the checkboxes in the profile editor will be invisible but also
	profile for which running as admin was selected earlier will not be started
	with admin rights anymore.
	<br />(Default value for this option: off)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>To avoid the risk of damages to your software installation you should keep the first three
options activated in this page.</b>
