MainInfo=Information about the D-Fend Reloaded file structure
MainInfoPart1=D-Fend Reloaded is 100% Vista compatible. This means it respects the conect of dividing the program data into program files and user data. If you have installed D-Fend Reloaded in "user profile mode", the program files are located in the program files folder ("C:\Program files\D-Fend Reloaded" by default) and the user data files are located in a subfolder of the user profile directory ("C:\Users\<you>\D-Fend Reloaded" by default). When D-Fend Reloaded is running it is not writing to the program folder any more. All setup data is stored in the user profile subfolder.
MainInfoPart2=DOSBox and Windows do not use the same directory sturctures. The programs inside DOSBox only see a subset of the whole Windows directory sturcture. So games running in DOSBox cannot damage your system files (unless you setup DOSBox to use your real "C:\" as drive C: in DOSBox). In most cases you want to mount a folder like "C:\OldGames" as drive C: in DOSBox. This means if you store a game in "C:\OldGames\Somegame" you can access this game in DOSBox via "C:\Somegame". But you do not need to worry about mounting drives at all because D-Fend Reloaded is mounting the right folders automatically for you.
MainInfoPart3=You can store your game where ever you want. But it is recommended to use the predefined games directory ("C:\Users\<you>\D-Fend Reloaded\VirtualHD"). If you use this directory for your games, D-Fend Reloaded can use relative paths in the profile (".\VirtualHD\NewGame" instead of "C:\Users\<you>\D-Fend Reloaded\VirtualHD\NewGame"). If D-Fend Reloaded knows where the games files are located relatively to the program data directory, it can transfer the games files to another installation or can make installer packages for you. With absolute pathes this isn't possible.
Page1Info=Please choose the type of profile you want to create.
Page2Info=Please setup where the game or program file you want to start is located. If you choose a subfolder of the given directory for the files, D-Fend Reloaded will be able to use relative paths.
Page3Info=Please select a template for the new profile.
Page4Info=Please define the meta information for the new game or programm. All the information are optional and can be changed and complated via the profile editor at any time. This means there is no need to fill out all this fields now but it is recommended to choose at least a name for the profile.

But if you put them in a subdirectory of %s D-Fend Reloaded will be able to store the paths as relative paths. Only with relative paths you can use the "Build installer" and "Transfer games" functions from the "Extras" menu.
BaseDataFolder.Info=You can place the games data files (manuals etc.) in any directory. But if you put them in a subdirectory of %s D-Fend Reloaded will be able to store the paths as relative paths. Only with relative paths you can use the "Build installer" and "Transfer games" functions from the "Extras" menu.

TemplateInfo=The auto setup templates are a special type templates. Each auto setup template was created for one special game. D-Fend Reloaded trys to find a matching auto setup template by the given game or program file. Therefor it compares a checksum calculated over the real file with the checksums stored in the auto setup templates and compares the real filename with the filenames stored in the auto setup templates.[13][13]If there is a by checksum matching auto setup template you should use this template for the new profile because this auto setup template was made exactly for the game or program you just want to add. You should only use a only by filename matching template if there is no by checksum matching template.[13][13]If there is a auto setup template for you game or program but D-Fend Reloaded does not show it in the first two dropdown boxes then you may have another not recognized version of the program.[13][13]Alternatively you can use one of your normal templates for the new profile at any time. But if you use a normal template there is no guarantee the game or program will run immediately with out any further setup.
TemplateType1=Use compatible auto setup template (recommended)
TemplateType1Info=This templates are made right for the selected game. They match to the program file via a checksum.
TemplateType2=Use auto setup template which only matchs by filename
TemplateType2Info=This templates match to the given program file by the filename but not by the checksum. May be your game version just differs from the game version the auto setup template was made from.
